# DeepHit+
Code for the Paper "Automatic Feature Selection for Survival Analysis with Deep Learning"

## Welcome
I will be uploading my code from my previous research as a master's student in the coming weeks, and hope it can be helpful. Please bear with me, as I'll try to do some clean-up for better usage too.

### Current status of upload
The currently uploaded code base has full functionality to run DeepHitPlus, FilterDeepHitPlus and HybridDeepHitPlus (it does not include SparseDeepHitPlus and AttentiveDeepHitPlus, as these were experimental and not covered in the NIPS Workshop Paper, although I encourage further research on these ideas with the charm of 'inbuilt' feature selection). As a next step, I would like to edit this README file with short instructions on how to run the models.

### MSc Thesis
My MSc Thesis gives a broad background of survival analysis with deep learning, introducing the relevant concepts from the ground up. Good as an introduction for a reader outside the field, or for covering new models and additional details not included in the short paper below.

### Paper - Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS 2018
The paper gives a short summary of the highlights of my research. Useful for a quick glance of the results, but due to the page limit very abbreviated.
