Code for the Paper "Automatic Feature Selection for Survival Analysis with Deep Learning"

## Welcome
I will be uploading my code from my previous research as a master's student in the coming weeks, and hope it can be helpful. Please bear with me, as I'll try to do some clean-up for better usage too.

### MSc Thesis
My MSc Thesis gives a broad background of survival analysis with deep learning, introducing the relevant concepts from the ground up. Good as an introduction for a reader outside the field, or for covering new models and additional details not included in the short paper below.

### Paper - Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) Workshop at NeurIPS 2018
The paper gives a short summary of the highlights of my research. Useful for a quick glance of the results, but due to the page limit very abbreviated.
